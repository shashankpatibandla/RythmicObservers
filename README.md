# RythmicObservers

#### Research Questions – 

1. How __**different species**__ of Oak Tree respond to different **climatic conditions** [we are planning to observe its effects on leafing, budding and flowering process in oak trees]. 
2. Find out when __**Leaf size**__ is maximum or minimum for different species **throughout the year** and what other data corelates with it.
3. Provided with **weather, soil and seasonal conditions**, we shall be analysing _much more in detail_.

##### **Background Research** 
Areas:- 
_Shashank_ (Weather data over the area for 17-18 years), 
_Goutam_ (Soil conditions, study about oak trees), 
_Sujana_ (General background about mortem arboretum)

1. _Business understanding and audience profile_ - done by shashank and sujana - proofread by goutam
2. _Data cleaning for consistency_ - done by shashank and goutam - proofread by sujana
3. _Dividing the data into sessions_  - done by goutam and sujana - proofread by shashank
4. _find common patterns between the 2 years_ - done by goutam and shashank - proofread by sujana
5. _Create basic analysis_ - done by goutam and sujana - proofread by shashank
5. _Create Visualizations_ - done by shashank and sujana - proofread by goutam

_**[we will be adding tasks after we start on the project]**_

**Timeline for the project**
_09/10/2018 – 11/21/2018_

##### __**Client Questions**__
1. Age data of trees
2. Climatic observation
3. Soil Conditions
