# RythmicObservers

#### Research Questions – 

1. How __**different species**__ of Oak Tree respond to different **climatic conditions** [we are planning to observe its effects on leafing, budding and flowering process in oak trees]. 
2. Find out when __**Leaf size**__ is maximum or minimum for different species **throughout the year** and what other data corelates with it.
3. Provided with **weather, soil and seasonal conditions**, we shall be analysing _much more in detail_.

##### **Background Research** 
Areas - 
_Shashank_ (Weather over the area for 17-18 years), 
_Goutam_ (Soil conditions, study about oak trees), 
_Sujana_ (General background about mortem arboretum)

1. _Business understanding_
2. _Data cleaning for consistency_
3. _Dividing the data into sessions_ 
4. _find common patterns between the 2 years_
5. _Create basic analysis_
5. _Create Visualizations_

_**[we will be adding tasks after we start on the project]**_

**Timeline for the project**
_09/10/2018 – 11/21/2018_

##### __**Client Questions**__
