# RythmicObservers Work Plan

#### Research Questions – 

1. All Species, categorized by year, Total records [R box plots]
2. In which year (2017 vs 2018) there was the highest number of buds?
3. Does the number of flower and leaf budding impact the no of fruits observed?
4. Which species has the highest number of fruit observed and riped?
