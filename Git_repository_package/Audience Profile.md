#### Requirements/needs
*_Organizational Requirement_* - They are looking for people to assist them in providing information that will help achieve their goals of planting the right trees in the appropriate landscapes, thus enabling the visitors to study about the tree and enjoy it as well.<br/> 
*_Individual Requirements_* - Very much interested in knowing about how each species of Oak [collected from different parts of the world] react to the climatic and soil conditions at the arboretum.
To be more specific, they would like to know when each Oak species leaf out, flower and fruit. 
In simple terms, how does each species respond to changes in time.  
This short term goal will help them achieve a long term goal of analysing and understanding how the trees will respond to changing climatic conditions. 
 
#### Priorities
Global Tree Conservation. Prevent extinction and secure the trees that are most threatened throughout the world.
